%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ACF and PACF for momSleepQuality %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% ACF Plot for Y = momSleepQuality %%%
[momSleepQualityACF, momSleepQualitylags, momSleepQualitybounds] = autocorr(momSleepQuality{:,:});
autocorr(momSleepQuality{:,:}); % this syntax means I convert a table to a matrix by accessing the values of the table and thus making "momSleepQuality{:,:}" into a matrix, equivalent to function: "table2array"
figure; % makes sure plot doesn't vanish after calling another plot function
