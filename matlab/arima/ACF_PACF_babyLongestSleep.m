%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ACF and PACF for babyLongestSleep %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% ACF Plot for Y = babyLongestSleep %%%
[babyLongestSleepACF, babyLongestSleepACFlags, babyLongestSleepACFbounds] = autocorr(babyLongestSleep{:,:});
autocorr(babyLongestSleep{:,:}); % this syntax means I convert a table to a matrix by accessing the values of the table and thus making "babyLongestSleep{:,:}" into a matrix, equivalent to function: "table2array"
figure; % makes sure plot doesn't vanish after calling another plot function
